            Year: 4th </br>
            Major: Computer Science </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Iqra: Hi everyone! Our next guest for Humans of ICS is Ryan! Ryan, can you start off by introducing yourself?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Ryan: Hi, my name is Ryan Adra I'm a 4th year Computer Science major and my pronouns are he/him/his.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Why did you choose Computer Science as your major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: I think back in middle school, I watched the movie The Social Network. And I was like, “That's so cool that they coded this stuff to make a social network and it has a lot of impact!” Thinking back to it in retrospect, that movie was kind of trash and showcased how bad Mark Zuckerberg was. Then, I think in ninth grade I was in a social skills class and they talked about how it was time for us to pick a career. Then I began exploring careers and I realized I wanted to do CS. And then I did stuff back in high school related to CS, like taking AP CS and participating in a summer camp. I began to enjoy coding and programming, but when I came to college, I actually started to not like programming and software engineering as much as I used to.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Oh no!
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
          R: But, I still want to do something in tech for sure. For a while, I questioned what roles in tech I really liked and fit me and my personality, and that’s where I ended up in UX design because I would like to design interfaces and user experiences that are more inclusive and accessible for users so they can enjoy the products they're using on the daily, whether it be a website or an app or anything else really. And that's why I still love being in tech. I still feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create good social impact from it.
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I think it’s still great that you found your passion during college and figured out what you want to do! And as long as you are happy with what you are doing, that’s all that really matters. Next question. Can you tell me something that you're passionate about? It could be non-tech related as well. And where did you develop that passion?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: It's hard for me to say that I have a strong passion.  but I would say I am passionate about fashion and style which started in high school. I feel like I was someone who puts on a face for people in order to fit in with the rest of the crowd and for people to like me. With my fashion and style, I found a way to express myself more and it provided a creative outlet for me to show different sides of me to everyone. That's just been growing stronger and stronger throughout the years. But, because of COVID, lately I've not been dressing to impressing. You know, I think it’s one of my strongest passions, but it also going back to the point I said earlier, I don't know if I can say that's a strong passion of mine because other people pursue careers in fashion.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I would still consider it valid! Everyone has varying degrees of how much they pursue their passion! How would you describe your style?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: I feel like it's hard for me to pinpoint a word or two to really describe my fashion sense because I just wear whatever makes me feel comfortable. I also like to explore and experiment and wear clothes that most people won’t typically wear on a normal basis.. I'm a mix between both comfortable and experimental. When I try something new, I ask myself if it makes me feel like myself, and if it does, that’s cool. If it doesn’t, I’ll just try something else. I don’t like sticking to the same style because like me, my style is forever growing and evolving.I also like to explore colors just because men's fashion can be boring with their colorsAnd sometimes I wish they would add more color to their clothes.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So, what's one piece of advice you would give yourself before coming to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: I think be ready to accept failure. Back in high school, I was a perfectionist and a goody two-shoes student trying to do everything right. You know in these past three years, I've encountered so much failure. I've encountered so much rejection. At this point, I've learned to stop putting my expectations so high and put them lower so that I don't feel as bad. I acknowledge that there are bumps here and there and that I still have another chance to do something about it or maybe it’ll help open up an opportunity that might be better for me. For example, applying for internships. That was hard, but I feel like it's opened up opportunities for me to find out what I would like to do in the tech world. And I really appreciate that. I would say accepting failure and learning how to cope with it. Just because I know it’s pretty inevitable. Everyone's going to experience it, but it's a matter of how you're going to deal with it yourself. Or if you have a support system, how you can reach out to your support system in this time of need and learn how to move forward. To quote BTS, “life goes on” and it's a matter of whether you want to move forward or not.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, completely agree. I think, especially in CS majors, imposter syndrome is such a big thing. And the best thing to do is change your mindset. If and when you experience failure, you need to learn how to overcome it and think of it as a learning opportunity. It's obviously easier said than done, but I definitely think that it’s a common struggle that all of us face and the best thing we can do is learn how to move forward.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: Yeah, I agree with that as well. Sometimes I wish there'd be more conversations where we talk about these things beyond saying “I didn’t get this internship.” I feel like even after having those conversations with people, I still feel alone in that sense. But being able to talk more about it and more frequently, it makes me feel better and after coming to UCI, I’ve learned that you really aren't alone. It's just a matter of expressing it to others and finding other people who feel the same way. I feel like that was pretty important.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, I 100% agree with everything you're saying. So, now we're going to move on to the more personalized questions based on what you said in your interest form. I believe you are one of the board members for Commit the Change (CTC). Can you tell me more about your role, about the organization and why you joined?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: Sure, I think I'll start off on why I joined. I wanted to do something where I can create a product in tech that really does have a positive impact in local communities. And I was hoping there'd be a club like it [when I came to UCI] but there wasn't. But, then CTC was made and I found it interesting. My friend, Kamille, told me about it and how she was a part of it. In summer, she mentioned how there was an opening so I took up the opportunity and now I’m here. In terms of the position, that kind of just came about because I made some marketing graphics for IG. From there, I got a position and became the VP of Content Creation.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Oh wow, that's nice! And can you talk a little bit about the organization for everyone who doesn't know what CTC is?</p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: We are an organization that really focuses on creating software and developing software for nonprofit communities in order to create social good in our local communities. Our mantra is tech with purpose. We're different because we're actually working with nonprofits. So in a sense, we're working with real people and working on a software that's actually going to impact our local communities. But, I feel like we’re giving people opportunities to explore different things in tech too. I know back in my first year, I thought CS was literally just programming. But now, there's opportunities for designers, at least, which I found really interesting. And maybe there might be more opportunities for being a tech lead or being a PM, which I also think is really cool. I also like how they bring industry practices into the club so that more people who don't have the industry knowledge or industry experience can experience it in school, which I feel like has been lacking from my education at least.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, I definitely think one of the biggest struggles students face is what kind of personal projects they should work on to get real world experience. And many courses don’t go over full-stack development, so clubs that give you opportunities to work on real products is one of the best experiences that a student can be a part of.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
          R: I agree!
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
          I: I also saw on your interest form that you put traveling, obviously pre-COVID, as one of your hobbies. Can you tell me about your favorite place you have visited so far? And if you could live anywhere in the world other than wherever you are right now, where would you live and why?
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: To answer your first question, I would say the Philippines. I actually was born in the Philippines, but I moved here when I was six. So I've kind of been here ever since. So I think two summers ago, the summer after my first year I was able to go back to the Philippines for the first time in 13 years. And that was like, not to be cheesy, a life changing experience. Just because I was able to relive my childhood home, reconnect with family members, and experience the culture and lifestyle of the Filipino people, which honestly is a really big privilege knowing that not everyone has the luxury to fly back to the Philippines; I know I didn’t as someone who is an immigrant.. I felt like going back home to the Philippines helped me regain a sense of cultural identity since I felt like my understanding of being Filipino was declining over time.  It also helped me gain a new perspective on life where I feel more grateful for the things I have and I am appreciating the small things in life. In terms of worrying about the future, I still do that. But I've learned to appreciate the present for the way it is.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: And, where would you want to live if you could live anywhere in the world?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: Fun fact, I was supposed to study abroad this quarter in South Korea. I really wanted to go just because it'd be really interesting to live in a different country. I would be afraid to do it, but I also feel like living by yourself in a different country where you kind of have to learn everything on your own, will be a really cool experience. And not to be cheesy again, but it would be a life changing experience where I can learn more in terms of what I can do as an independent person living by myself, how to interact with people that I’m not accustomed to, and also learn more about different cultures just because I’m someone who really appreciates seeing things from different perspectives . I’ve seen memes on social media about people who go to study abroad, but I think it'd be nice to live independently and learn how to do things by myself without my parents' support.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, I agree! And what new skills or things have you been doing more since we have remote school?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: In the beginning of quarantine, I would try cooking a little bit and then I got busy. I used to take walks and then I stopped doing it just because I didn't have time for it anymore. I actually got into UI/UX design more seriously. So I would say that's like a new skill that I've been trying to develop during quarantine and I'm really glad for it because I feel happier with the work I'm doing. It's something I was always interested in, but I never really took it upon myself to explore more about it until now. I feel like I'm still definitely learning and I’ll probably take my time to learn more about it after school. Fun fact, I am graduating this quarter. So, hopefully in winter and spring I’ll learn more about it and take it more seriously, like participating in design academies.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So for anyone interested in UI/UX design, what resources would you recommend they should they look into?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            R: That's a good question, because I feel like I don't have a perfect answer for it haha. I feel like I'm still trying to gather good resources and my tool belt with how I’m learning design. The way that I got into it was probably watching YouTube videos because it's available for everyone. And I feel like being able to hear people in the industry talk more helps me learn the best. I can read an article and understand what they’re talking about, but I would much rather learn from people who are actually experiencing it. And also, doing hands on experience is a really good start. There's also a lot of communities on LinkedIn too that I would like to explore as well.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Great! And for our last segment, I have a list of rapid fire questions. First, early riser or night owl?</br>

            R: Puppies.

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Staying in or going out? </br>
            R: I would say, I'm still a mix of both just because I like to go out with friends. But, you know, once I get tired of socializing, I'm just going to stay inside and not talk to anyone.
          </p>
