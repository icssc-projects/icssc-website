          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            We hope you enjoy reading about Sarah and her passion for mobile app development, her experience in the Campuswide Honors Collegium, and her hobby of playing poker!

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Year: 3rd </br>
            Major: Computer Science </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Iqra: Hello, everyone! On today’s segment of Humans of ICS, we have Sarah! Sarah, can you start off by introducing yourself: your name, year, and major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Sarah: Hi, I’m Sarah! I’m a 3rd year majoring in Computer Science.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Why did you choose CS as your major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: In high school, my parents were kind of pressuring me to find something that I enjoyed, but all of the classes I took, I got no joy out of them - like bio, chemistry, and math. So then I took AP Computer Science and I really enjoyed problem solving and how we can use computers to tackle everyday problems. So I really wanted to pursue CS so that I can make real world changes, in a way.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, that’s great to hear! So, what are you passionate about and where did you develop that passion?
        </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Oh, I'm passionate about mobile app development. It started in high school when I participated in a team and made an application for the school that the school promoted and the students used. It was really nice being able to help the community, specifically the school. And then I pursued this passion in college because I'm currently a software developer. More specifically, I'm a mobile app developer. I also like playing basketball too. I actually went to a lot of our games this school year. Wait, I'm actually wearing their jersey
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Haha very nice! So, what kind of app did you make for your school?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: So basically it had resources that students can use to easily access like the bell schedule, planner, etc. And I think that after I left, they continued to build upon it and made it more interactive as well.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Wow, that's really impressive. So what's one piece of advice you would give yourself before coming to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: So I was really stressed out about finding friends, but I've definitely found a lot of people who I've become really close with and who I've just genuinely found a deep connection with, especially people in CS. So I would say don't stress about making friends, because it'll happen.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I think that's great advice. For most people coming to college, it's a new place, new people, and it’s hard. But I think just coming in with a clean mindset really helps a lot. So, I also saw that you are a Student Software Developer at the UCI Student Center and Event Services. Can you tell us about how you got involved? What do you do for them and what's your favorite part about it?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Oh yeah. I work on mobile apps, like I said before, I do the maintenance and development for the mobile applications, so that the students on campus can use them. And I work on ZOTFinder and UCI Now. For how I got involved, I basically just saw a flyer and I remembered my passion for mobile app development back in high school that I hadn't revisited because I got into the Student Center in my sophomore year. So I thought it would be a cool way to not only make a living as a part time job, but also to use it as an outlet to kind of live out my passion in a way. When people ask about my hobbies, it's kind of weird, but I say work is my hobby.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I mean, that's great. Like you love what you're doing, so that's all that matters, right? For the people that don’t know about ZOTFinder and UCI Now, can you elaborate on it and what you did for those apps?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: ZOTFinder is a navigation app that you can use to find your classes. It's basically a Google Maps that is kind of personalized for UCI. It's in no way better than Google Maps. It's used by a lot of people when they first come to UCI who want to know where their classes are at the start of the quarter. And yeah, it has an interactive map, but we use the Google Maps API for that. UCI Now has a ring mall feature where you can look up events that are happening on Ring Mall. And also it has a Wayfinder feature where you can do indoor navigation and helps you navigate through the Student Center. So if you want to find where Panda Express or where Pacific Ballroom is, it’ll help you find it. It also has a study room booking feature called Courtyard Study Lounge where you can book rooms.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So can you tell us more specifically about what you did on those apps?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: For ZOTFinder, I maintain it and I implemented the recent redesign of it.So I basically coded out a lot of the redesign because at the time I was the only Android developer working there. I even got help from one of the UI/UX designers at my workplace! I also implemented small updates to ZOTFinder. Like, I implemented this feature where when you're going to your destination, you can see how long it will take and how many miles you need to walk to get there. It’s not really important.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That is important!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Haha, thanks for hyping me up! Yeah, so for UCI Now, me and my mentor worked on the Courtyard Study Lounge feature. So I implemented that and I've also helped maintain the other features . I also implemented a feature with my mentee called Virtual Events where you can add virtual events so that other students at UCI can attend them. It's to basically help with the current pandemic going on to help kind of unite the UCI community.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I also saw that you're a part of the Campuswide Honors Collegium and I feel like a lot of people are not familiar with exactly, you know, what it entails and what you do. So can you tell us more about your experience and what you're doing as part of that program?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Yeah, I got into the Campuswide Honors Collegium when I was a freshman. I have to take these certain cores like humanities, social science and science core. And basically it gives me a breadth of study. I get to learn how to develop my critical thinking, and reading skills. I also learned a lot about science, which I'm not really good at. I previously took courses in philosophy and psychology, and now I'm taking a Chemistry course and learning about how the world works. They take it really seriously. In addition, I get priority enrollment, which is super nice!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I bet!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: And I'm also a part of the Student Council as the club’s Secretary. And initially when I first got on it last year, I was the Fundraising Chair. I hosted fundraisers to get funds so that the CHC could host events for the students in the program.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So as part of the honors program, you're doing research, right?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Yeah, but I’m doing it in my senior year. So I've just started the journey for that. I can't really say a lot about it. I've already reached out to a professor and he's ready to take me into his group. But, I don’t have too much to say yet about it.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah, totally! So, you talked about one of your hobbies being playing poker. When did you start and how often do you play?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Haha! When I say I like to play poker, I didn't mean I was good at it! I do it just recreationally, like with friends and also online. I actually started when I was in elementary school and I really sucked. Like I had no idea what I was doing. Now, I’ve gotten a little bit smarter, hopefully, at least I get the rules now and I get the mind games. And it's really interesting to play with friends because you know, we only play for at most a few bucks because I will not let myself gamble and end up broke. But yeah, it's just a hobby of mine and it's really fun getting to play against your friends!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: And since we're all under quarantine, what have you been doing to pass your time and what is the first thing you plan on doing once it is over?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: Since I’m a CS major and I’m used to looking at a screen all day,I used to be able to combat that by just going outside and exploring, exercising, seeing friends. But now since I can't do that, I've actually been painting to kind of keep my eyes from looking at a screen all day. I actually am painting now! Have you ever watched Spongebob as a kid?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yes, of course!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            <img class="u-box-shadow-lg img-fluid" src="../../assets/img/humans-of-ics/2019-2020/sarah_li/painting.jpg" style="float: left; max-width: 300px; margin-right: 50px;">
            S: So, you know that bold and brash painting of Squidward? So, I painted that but with an anteater!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That’s so cute! It’s really good!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            S: It's a small canvas, but you know, one of my coworkers put the idea out there. She was like someone should paint Squidward bold and brash but with an anteater. And I thought, “hmmm, careful what you wish for!”
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Hahah! So for our last segment, we're going to have a rapid fire question. So I'll say like this or that and you'll choose one option or the other.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So pineapple on pizza, yay or nay? </br>
            S: Is there a neither option? I’ve never had it but I’m not against it.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Mountains or the beach? </br>
            S: The beach.

          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
