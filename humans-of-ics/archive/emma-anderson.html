            Our FIRST spotlight for Humans of ICS is Emma Anderson!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            We hope you enjoy reading about Emma and her journey into Informatics, advocacy in female empowerment through technology, goals of starting her own company, and funny stories as a KUCI radio DJ!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Year: 4th </br>
            Major: Informatics with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship </br>
            Personality Type: ISTP </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Justine: So my first question is pretty much just a way for you to introduce yourself. Where are you from? And what brought you to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Emma: I am from Los Angeles. I chose UCI because they are one of the few campuses that has my major. I always wanted to study HCI and it’s the only UC that has Informatics as an option. It was pretty much an immediate yes when UCI accepted me.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Why did you choose Informatics as your major? What is the story of how you got interested in Informatics and knew that Informatics was a thing? Because at least for me, I didn’t even know Informatics was an option until I came here.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I was lucky to have started in computer science pretty early. I had a lot of older female mentors who went into college earlier and they pursued a similar path to most Informatics students, where they start off as computer science and then realize, “Oh wait, HCI is actually a really interesting field,” and then they transition into Informatics. I always knew I wanted to code. It was more about getting behind the ethics of what we code and the impact it’s going to make on the user. Informatics was a way for me to explore that.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Do you have any advice for ICS students who aren’t sure if they have what it takes to pursue different opportunities?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: With a lot of the opportunities I’ve taken advantage of at UCI, I was never qualified on paper to do them. During my freshman year, Calit2 had a research opportunity available and I thought, “Well, I have only done two quarters of programming through the 30 series,” but also, “Why not? This is a project that interests me. I want to work on this new technology, so why not just apply?”. And I think that is the first step. By just applying to something, you’ll be surprised how often you’ll get accepted. I ended up doing research with Calit2 for two years after that.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Where did you go to find these opportunities? Where would you tell people to look for them?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: First, if you’re going for on campus opportunities I would suggest looking at the UROP program; specifically, programs like MDP and SURF-IoT. They connect you with a professor directly. It’s not one of those things where you have to worry about going to office hours. You just submit an application and explain why you’re interested in a project. If they like you, then they’ll let you on. It’s a very streamlined process.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: That’s really cool because, at least for me, I would be scared to go approach a professor. I thought that was the only way that I could do something!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Yeah! It’s a huge problem and I have tried to spend my time at UCI encouraging women to apply to research opportunities. A lot of girls I’ve met, through WICS or other clubs, are scared because they don’t know where to start. “Am I qualified to do this role? Do I need to be best friends with a professor before I do research?” MDP and SURF-IoT are great outlets to get around those fears.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            <img class="u-events__image" src="../../assets/img/humans-of-ics/E_Anderson/EAnderson-Edit4.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 300px; margin-left: 50px;">
            J: What is your most memorable experience at UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: My experience at UCI has been touched by my involvement in the campus radio station. That’s where I met my family outside of computer science. I would say that I have two really distinct families- one being my Women in Computer Science family and the other being my KUCI radio family. KUCI is a nice balance of people that I share outside hobbies with, like my love for music, my love for going to shows, even playing my own instruments too and jamming out with other DJs. And then with WICS, they’re my support group of females who are trying to make it in tech. We lift each other up and give each other the support we need to really score that internship and ace that interview.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Who is your biggest role model/influence in your life?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: My influence is always changing. Even in short periods of time I can be influenced by someone I met for only 10 minutes. I was in SF last weekend, talking to the company that I will be joining in the summer. I met the company’s Head of Mobile and he explained that he joined the startup when it was only ten people. He’s been there for five years, growing the company from the ground up. That is something I would love to do. To start somewhere really small, be in a close-knit team, and watch a product transform over a couple years to the point where it’s heavily invested in and is a bigger company than it started off as.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Well, that kind of transitions into the next question! I was going to ask where do you see yourself in 5 years?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I’ve thought about this a lot because everyone asks that question! I envision myself starting my own company. Personally, I am very invested in femtech! Birth control services, period tracking applications, and similar products. I want to be working in an all-female team, making products for women.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: I heard that you like traveling and you studied abroad in Sweden for 6 months. So, where has your favorite place been that you’ve traveled to? </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I think the most surprising place was Norway. I never thought to go there, and I don’t think I would’ve gone there had I not studied in Scandinavia. But it is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. The Norwegian fjords are these tall green mountains that you get to sail through on a boat. It is so peaceful, so calming. There is so much nature there. I encourage anyone to go. If you’re going to Europe, then sure, Paris and London are great locations - but, visiting obscure places like Norway is definitely a suggestion of mine.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Where would you like to go that you’ve never been?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I wish I explored more of Germany. I want to visit Munich. That’s where I am going to try to go during Spring Break!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            <img class="u-box-shadow-lg img-fluid" src="../../assets/img/humans-of-ics/E_Anderson/EAnderson-Edit3.jpg" style="float: left; max-width: 300px; margin-right: 50px;">
            J: So I also heard that your favorite class at UCI is Language of Love! So, can you tell me more about what that class is about? Why is it your favorite? And the official name so that people reading can find it? Because I tried to look it up, but I wasn’t sure!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I don’t even know if they are offering it anymore to be honest! That was such a random class. I think it was an arts GE. I signed up because I thought the title was hilarious. I didn’t know if it was going to be about dating or literature. It turned out to be a class about how the French have viewed love throughout history. It’s pretty pessimistic, there’s a lot of talk about how love is mediated and how love is controlled by the male figure in the relationship. You dive deep into the dynamic of two people being in a relationship and all the other factors that affect that relationship.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: So you already told us about being a radio DJ, but I prepared another question about it because I think it’s really cool and want to hear more! Do have anything you’d like to share about it - like a favorite memory or something unexpected that happened?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Well, funny story, an ICS student actually called into my show and asked to submit a secret admirer request on her behalf. I was so nervous, but I delivered the message and announced on air that “Hey, this girl likes you if you’re listening out there, you have a secret crush!” And the boy, who is also an ICS student, called in and said “Oh, I like her too can you let her know if she’s listening?” And they are still dating to this day.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Oh my gosh, that’s so cute!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Playing matchmaker is not something that I planned to do, but it was a crazy and fun experience!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: That kind of wraps up the main questions, but now I have a rapid fire/”this or that” kind of section.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: First one is: pineapple on pizza, yay or nay? </br>
            E: Oh hell yay.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Mountains or Beach? </br>
            E: Beach!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            J: Dogs or Cats? </br>

            E: iOS! Only iOS!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">

            E: Hm, Cake!
