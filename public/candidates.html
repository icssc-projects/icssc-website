              Hi gamers! My name is Pham, and I'm really excited to be running as next year's ICS Student Council Co-President alongside my amazing friend Anna Chan! As the ICSSC Events Chair for this year, I've hosted both virtual and in-person events to bring the ICS community together such as the ICS Bonfire and WebJam. In the last 2 years that I've been a part of the ICSSC events committee, I've gained a lot of experience with handling details and adapting to change, especially in light of all of the changes between in-person and remote instruction. For example, this year, the events committee put on ICSSC Brain Games for the first time, a week-long competition consisting of several challenging games where groups of students could compete for both money and a donation to a charity of their choice. With this event, I really wanted to emphasize the importance of collaboration and building relationships with others as these are aspects of the college experience that I feel ICSSC should provide. As co-president, I want to continue to foster an inclusive community and create an experience that people will cherish.
              <br>
              <br>
              Outside of ICSSC, I'm also involved in VenusHacks as co-president and Hack at UCI as a logistics organizer. In these roles, I've gained a lot more experience in communicating with many different people such as faculty, company representatives, and alumni. I hope to bring this experience into ICSSC to help integrate our organization into the ICS community as I believe collaborating with companies and other clubs for events will strengthen our relationships and provide students with more opportunities to grow.
              <br>
              <br>
              ICSSC has provided me with some of my closest friends, and I've made so many memories at events over the past 2 years. I hope to implement new opportunities for other students to build strong relationships that will carry on past graduation. I believe that ICSSC is really special in how it balances different aspects of the college experience, and I want to help further our mission of helping students succeed professionally, academically, and socially as next year's co-president.

              <p class="mb-4">
                Hi everyone! My name is Anna Chan and I am currently a third-year computer science major. I am really excited to be running for Co-President with my friend that I was able to meet through ICS Student Council, Pham!
                <br>
                <br>
                Since joining ICSSC two years ago, I have been a part of the events committee where I was able to work alongside Pham and my fellow committee members in creating and organizing both virtual and in-person events and workshops such as our first ever Typing Tournament. 
                Recently, this past Winter quarter, I had the opportunity to lead some of our committee in coordinating logistics for our general events. It was through this experience that I was able to work closely with other students within ICSSC such as the corporate outreach committee and our mentorship program, Bits and Bytes. This leadership experience has taught me how to effectively communicate with groups of people within and outside of ICSSC, delegate and organize tasks to help avoid miscommunication, and how to enable others' ideas with guidance and support while adapting to ever-changing environments and needs of students, all skills I hope to utilize to further develop ICSSC and, through it, our ICS community.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, my favorite aspect of being in the events committee was that I was able to meet a variety of students and learn about their experiences, both good and bad. It allowed me to gain a holistic understanding of the ICS community, helping me identify how I can utilize our role as the ICS Student Council to give each student the support and resources they need for their professional, academic, and social needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, this past year I've been working as the webmaster for ICSSC to manage and update our website. While this was more of a technical experience, managing our website has shown me the importance of providing a platform for members of the community.
                <br>
                <br>
                A big part of why I've become so passionate about ICSSC is not only the variety of resources we provide through our events, projects, and social media platforms, but also how welcoming my fellow members were to not only me, but also to everyone that they interacted with. All the people that I've been able to meet and my experience with them throughout these past two years has only invigorated my desire to give back to them and future ICS students. I hope to share and provide a similar experience to all of you as Co-President of ICSSC.
                <br>
                <br>
                I aim to empower and bring the ICS community together by collaborating with other student organizations, faculty, companies, alumni, and hopefully other schools within UCI to advance ICS Student Council's ability to improve your time here at UCI. To do so, I plan on developing more resources such as professional and technical workshops and hackathons, tailoring our events to be more accessible for a broader range of students, and bridging the gap between students and faculty and companies in order to provide more research, learning, and professional opportunities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The tech industry is vastly diverse and so are the people within it. Supporting such a diversified community is a big task to uptake. However, I am confident that by listening to your needs and input, I will be able to grow alongside you and assist ICSSC in better serving members of the ICS community. Thank you and I hope you'll consider me and Pham as your next year's Co-Presidents!

                Hello ICSSC and the ICS community! I'm Ryan Mohta, a three-year ICSSC member and current Internal Vice President. I'm running to be next year's President because I'm extremely passionate about ICSSC, believe I'm the most qualified person to lead ICSSC next year based on my past experiences, and have a wide selection of ideas and leadership strategies to make next year an amazing experience!
                <br>
                <br>
                Over the last two and a half years, I've steadily increased my involvement and impact within ICSSC while developing a stronger connection to our council and its members. I started out by joining the Events and Projects Committees my freshman year, which gave me both event planning and coding skills and introduced me to the different parts of ICSSC. Becoming a byte (mentor) for our Bits and Bytes mentorship/friend group sophomore year gave me a chance to lead a moderately-sized group of people, and gave me the confidence to have a larger presence and take on more responsibilities within the council itself. By the end of my sophomore year, I felt like I was confident and prepared enough to run for (and eventually join) ICSSC's executive board as the Internal Vice President the following year!                
                <br>
                <br>
                As Internal Vice President this year, I've worked to bring our different committees together so members can bond with each other and have memorable experiences! To help people become closer with their own committees and interact with others outside of them, I created a brand-new series of inter-committee competitions this year known as “ICSSC Games.” It's known that competition brings teams together, so I played upon that idea by pitting our committees against each other in various virtual and outdoor activities. Several members have told me how much they enjoyed ICSSC Games and how much closer they felt with their committee members as a result! Aside from ICSSC Games, I also individually work with all of our committees and alongside our current co-presidents on executive board, so I've seen and even occasionally done some of what's involved for the President role first-hand.
                <br>
                <br>
                All of this experience has allowed me to see ICSSC at its best, but also notice some areas I could improve for next year. Communication within the board and among the rest of the council (and even non-council members) has markedly improved this past year thanks to our Discord server, but next year I hope to move away from primarily text-based communication to a mix of text, voice/video, and in-person, to discuss things more efficiently and avoid misunderstandings. Hand-in-hand with improved communication is making sure people are comfortable communicating with their peers, which is why I will strive to create a comfortable, no-judgement environment for people to express their ideas and uncover new perspectives.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another area I would like to improve next year is transparency: I think everyone in ICSSC should have the chance to know what's happening in the other parts of ICSSC they don't directly contribute towards, so they can better see what they are a part of. To accomplish this, I'll set up a system for each committee to highlight their accomplishments with everyone, and explore easier opportunities to be involved with different committees without being a formal member. Projects Committee pioneered this last year by allowing external contributors on their projects, but I would like to expand this to other committees also (such as helping Events plan an event or helping Corporate Outreach create a corporate packet).
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm really glad I've gotten to be part of ICSSC's journey these past three years! I've grown as a person, programmer, and leader, and would love to use this growth to inspire others to have the same experiences I did. I'm confident I can use my past experience and future plans to push ICSSC forward. Thank you and I hope you will consider me for ICSSC President!

                Hello! My name is Emily Doan (she/her) and I am a third year Computer Science student running for ICS Student Council’s Internal Vice President (IVP). Asides from being the current Public Relations Chair of ICSSC, I am a Graphic Design Intern at the Womxn’s Center for Success, Marketing Co-Chair for VenusHacks, have served on board at the Society of Women Engineers for 2 years, and worked in residential life for Middle Earth Housing.
                <br>
                <br>
                By being a part of ICSSC since 2020, I have acquired familiarity with the internal structure, especially cross-committee communication during my current position as Public Relations chair. I believe that I hold the qualifications and capabilities as an IVP, as shown through my other commitments, such as being able to recognize instances of discrimination, organizational skills, professional development, increasing member retention, and team-building. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If elected for IVP, I will do my best to ensure that we can all collaborate in an inclusive and safe space. As members of the ICS Student Council, we should feel comfortable in our identities and learn how to recognize our own implicit biases, before we seek to help other folks out of the general ICS student body. I wish to establish this by normalizing the use and display of pronouns, opening roundtable discussions regarding individual experiences as ICS students, and holding inclusivity workshops. ICSSC has provided open arms for me during my transition from engineering to CS, especially as someone with an underrepresented background, and I want to do the same for everyone else. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Other ideas that I hope to implement include spontaneous and informal socials such as group grocery shopping, lunch/dinner runs, hikes, and weekend walks to the local farmers market so that folks don’t have to feel alone while making the most out of their college experience. In efforts to promote academics, as folks are students before they are ICSSC members, I look to open study spaces for committee members through hosting group study sessions and reserving study rooms, as well as establishing a spreadsheet for members to find others in ICS classes. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, I hope that you all consider me during the election process and I hope to serve as your Internal Vice President for next year!

                Hi everyone! My name is William (though around here you might know me as Willmongus) and I'm a second-year majoring in data science. I came into UCI during the middle of the pandemic: classes were all online and I really didn't see myself finding all that many friends sliding into Zoom DMs. Like many others, I turned to the ICS clubs we have on campus to meet new people and was incredibly grateful to find such a fun and friendly community. I joined ICSSC as a member of the Projects committee and wrote articles introducing our programs before transferring to Events this year. As a logistics organizer for Hack@UCI, I have helped plan 3 hackathons that bring hundreds of tech enthusiasts together to build innovative projects in a collaborative setting. While the work I do is incredibly meaningful, it is the personal connections I have made that have had the greatest impact on my life.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm running for EVP because I believe in the potential of the ICS club community to offer an energetic and welcoming space for every student in the same way I experienced.  Every single ICS club brings something unique to the table (or maybe a stand-up treadmill desk would be more appropriate). They tailor to different interests, host different events, maybe even have different philosophies for how they want to achieve their mission. But they all share a common goal in developing a community where members are brought together by shared interests but stay together through forming stronger personal bonds that transcend a simple common class or hobby.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you put your trust in me to serve as External VP, I promise to give all the same trust and more towards supporting every ICS club to reach their fullest potential.
