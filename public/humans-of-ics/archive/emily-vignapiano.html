          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            We hope you enjoy reading about Emily and their passion for writing, wanting to become a professor, experience at the Grace Hopper Conference, and journeys across all of the 50 states!

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Year: 3rd </br>
            Major: Computer Science </br>
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Iqra: On today’s segment of Humans of ICS, we are interviewing Emily. Can you start off by introducing yourself: your name, year and major?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            Emily: Hi, my name is Emily! I’m a 3rd year, well I’m a transfer student and I’m a Computer Science major.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I read that you were a Math major in community college. What made you decide to switch to CS?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: The thing is I was originally CS when I was in CC, but then there were a couple of classes I wanted to take in the Math major and some I didn’t want to take in the CS major, so I swapped them.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What made you go into CS?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: When I was in high school, I took a programming class in Python and I absolutely fell in love with it and I had so much fun. And then I was like, I like this!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: All right. Sounds good. What are you passionate about and where did you develop that passion?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I feel like my main passion is CS just because why not be passionate about what you're majoring in. But I also do like writing, which is kind of ironic considering that when I was a kid, I did not like to do in-class writing assignments. I think the thing I figured out is that I like to write what I want to write, not what other people want me to write.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: 100%. What is one piece of advice you'd give yourself before coming to UCI?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: That's a tough one. I feel like the advice I'd give myself is probably the same advice that I would've given myself before starting in community college, which is just go to office hours and talk to your professors. Especially, I feel like now that a lot of these professors are going to be the people that are going to write me letters of rec that I need to know them better. I think my first quarter I was kind of afraid of most of my professors, like afraid to talk to most of my professors. So then it's like most of them probably don't know I exist anymore.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: I completely agree. I feel like most people are super intimidated when they're trying to go to office hours, but it helps so much. I feel that more people should go even if they're scared to ask the teacher a dumb question because no question is dumb.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Yeah, exactly.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: And where do you see yourself in five years?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Well, let's see, in five years,I want to take a couple of years off after I graduate and work in industry and then potentially come back and get either a master's or a PhD so that I could be a professor.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Oh, very nice. That's really cool. What class would you want to teach then?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I haven't taken enough classes here because I've only been here for a year. I feel like out of all of the classes that I've taken, I'd probably like teaching the 40 series, like 45c and 46. But I also feel like I'd probably like teaching the 30 series as well, even though I didn't take it here. I'm also really enjoying CS 162, but we'll see when I finish the class if I want to teach it
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Yeah. That's cool. All right, so now we're gonna move on to more personalized questions based on what you said in your interest form. So I read that you like to write short stories as you mentioned. So how long have you been writing and what type of stories do you usually write about?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I have been writing as a hobby probably since I was like 14, so let's see, like seven years or so and basically just fan fiction! I’m just going to be real with you!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's funny! So, how long are your stories, and do you share them? Can you tell us more about that?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Well, I mean, sometimes I share them. Sometimes I don't, it just depends on what it is. I do have an AO3 account and I probably have only posted like four things on it. Recently, I've only shared with really close friends.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's cool. I also saw that you travel a lot and that you've been to all 50 states before you turned 18. That's super cool. Can you tell us more about your trips? Are they road trips? What were your favorites? What were your least favorites? Where would you want to visit again, etc.?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: First of all, my mom was a really big traveler when she was a kid. She went to all of the lower 48 States before she was 10. So then she passed that love of traveling on to me. A lot of the trips have been road trips. One of the first ones that I remember was when I was four and my parents bought a motorhome and we drove across the country. I think we bought it in May and then we drove it across the country in October. So this was in 2002 and we drove across the country to visit my family in New York. And that was the first big trip in the motor home that I remember and probably the first big trip period that I remember. But it was a lot of fun!
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What’s it like living in a motorhome?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E:  It's interesting to say the very least because it's 31 feet long by about 6 feet wide. It's close quarters. The way that it's set up is that the cabs are in the front and then the bed that I usually sleep in, or at least the one that I did when I was about eight, is above the cab and then there's a pullout couch that turns into a bed that I slept on when I was younger because I rolled around a lot in my sleep so I didn't want to sleep in the top one. And there's a queen size bed in the back that my parents slept in.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What's been your favorite trip so far and where would you want to visit again?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: There are a lot of my favorite trips. The summer after I graduated from high school, my parents and I took a trip to Hawaii. That was a lot of fun. We stayed in Honolulu for a week. Fun fact about that: there I had to register for my first college classes. I was sitting in the hotel room registering for classes at 7:00 PM California time and it was about 4:00 PM Hawaii time. Another one of my favorite trips was more recently. My parents and I went to New York to visit my family and then we took a week to go up to Canada and see Niagara falls. That was definitely one of my favorites and I would definitely go back.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: That's really cool! So if you had to choose some other place other than California to live, what would you choose?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: I don't think I'd want to live in another state other than California. I love visiting all of the other states, but I am really happy here. Especially in Irvine, it feels more like my home than my parents’ house.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: All right, next question. I saw that you went to GHC in your first quarter. Can you tell us more about your experience? You know, what did you enjoy? What were your highlights and why would you recommend for other students to go as well?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: That trip was a whirlwind. I think it was the weekend of week one and we flew out Monday night. I guess it was a good thing that I was able to go see my professors in class for the first lectures and be able to be “Hi, I'm leaving for Grace Hopper. Bye!” And then the trip itself was a lot of fun. I think there were about 20 of us and since I was new to UCI, I hadn't met any of these people before. And yet I'm still acquaintances with most of the people that I went with and actually really close friends with a couple of them, I feel like I have like a tiniest bit of regret that I didn't take it as seriously as I probably could have. First of all, my resume was terrible at the time, so I was handing out this horrible resume and then I'm looking at my old resume versus my current resume and I'm just like, “Please can I go back in time?” It's definitely a good experience and if anyone is on the fence about going, I would say go.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: What have you been doing to pass time since we're all under quarantine? And what's the first thing that you plan on doing once quarantine ends?
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            E: Besides classes I've been playing a lot and I mean, a lot of Animal Crossing. It came out on the 20th of March. So then for the entirety of spring break, I did not stop playing for the most part. I'm pretty sure that I have over a hundred hours on Animal Crossing. Actually, I am going to check if you don't mind. According to my Switch, it says I played for 110 hours or more.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Wow! And for the last segment of our interview, we're going to do a rapid fire question.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: So, pineapple on pizza, yay or nay! </br>
            E: Yay.
         </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Mountains or the beach? </br>
            E: Mountains.
         </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Dogs or cats? </br>
            E: Both. But if I have to pick one, then dogs,
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Netflix or YouTube? </br>
            E: YouTube.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Facebook or Twitter? </br>
            E: Twitter.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: iOS or Android? </br>
            E: Android.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Cake or pie? </br>
            E: Um, depends on what kind of pie, but I think in general, cake.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Burger or hotdog? </br>
            E: Burger 100%.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: Coffee or tea? </br>
            E: Coffee.
          </p>

          <p class="h5 mb-4">
            I: And lastly, winter or summer? </br>
